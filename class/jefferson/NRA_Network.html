								In addition to the $9.7 million NRA Foundation grant tht the NRA received in 2009, the NRA and NRA Foundation shared almost 3.3 million dollars in salary. In 2009, the NRA Foundation also reimbursed the NRA for $4.2 million.

							<div id="box2_note" class="noteBox">
								Excluding NRA-affiliates, the NRA Foundation gave out 389 grants across 36 states totaling almost $5 million. Of that number, 331 grants worth almost $4 million funded youth-related programs and materials.

								Accounting experts do not find the NRA's structure atypical, because the world of non-profit and political finacing has become convoluted. PACs, 501(c)(3)'s and 501(c)(4)'s enable money to move easily between affiliates.

								The NRA also incurred some direct expenses, including the costs to participate in a debate in London on the United Nation's campaign to ban small arms. Conservatives dubbed the event the "Great UN Gun Debate."

								Observers and anti-gun activists view the NRA as a lobbying force and point to their ties to the multi-billion dollar gun industry as key to their success.

								<p>
									“They started out as a grassroots organization but they became an industry organization,” said Leah Gunn-Barrett, executive director for the advocacy group New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. “It’s economically-rooted, and that’s why they don’t want background checks because that would cut down on gun sales,” she said.

								<p>
									Pointing to legislative successes like their defeat of the universal background check bill last month, gun control advocates believe the NRA’s financial muscle has strangled Congressional attempts to pass new gun regulations.

								<p>
									“Essentially, they bought these politicians, like any special interest groups,” said Gunn-Barrett.

								<p>

									But that explanation doesn’t fully account for the NRA’s ubiquity or impact in American society. As the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~sb3425/nraMoney/article.html">'Money' graphic on the NRA’s efforts in the 2010 elections shows</a>, political donations and lobbying money do not always translate into electoral success.

								<p>
									Another way to understand the NRA’s immense presence is to return to its original mission at the community-level to examine its grassroots influence. The NRA Foundation, the NRA’s grant-making affiliate, distributed almost $5 million in 389 grants to non-NRA affiliates to support a variety of shooting-related activities. Of that number, 327 grants funded youth-focused programs such as 4-H youth development organizations, high schools, Junior ROTC programs and sports clubs, tax records show. The NRA also maintains a longstanding relationship with Speedway Charities, which in recent years has led the NRA to sponsor NASCAR races. But not all of their activities’ purposes are obvious: one grant in Texas was marked for “Conservation and meat processing.”

								<p>
									These kinds of grants establish the NRA as strong contributors to local communities that might not figure in national debates about gun rights. As a result, gun owners feel the NRA is a kind of beacon for their cause, their only representative in a crowd of critics.

								<p>
									“I don’t necessarily agree with everything they say and do but listen, they are the only political body out there that’s fighting for us,” said Darren Leung, 47, the owner of Westside Pistol and Rifle Range in Manhattan. “Everyone is calling them a “special interest” – yea, they only have one interest: to further gun rights. So I mean, what is the problem with that? Why is the NRA always demonized?”

								<p>
									As the only commercial civilian gun range in Manhattan and under the Bloomberg administration’s stringent gun policies, the NRA’s support means a lot to Leung and his range’s members. Westside has received NRA grants around $5000-$10,000 to maintain their facilities and provide training courses. Today, Westside counts about 2000 members, a number that has been on the rise in the last few years.

								<p>
									As for the gun manufacturers, Leung sees them as part of a larger family of gun owners: “You have to support your industry…If we don’t all stay together – ranges, manufacturers, the political body of us, where are we going to go?”

								<p>
									To Leung, the answer to that question is part of the reason the NRA continues to garner so much support.

								<p>
									“Bottom line is people want to support the cause but they didn’t know where to go. Being that they were the only entity out there fighting for us, it was, ‘Let’s support the NRA,’” said Leung.
